## PROBLEM DESCRIPTION

You are given an integer array nums. You are initially positioned at the array's first index, and each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position. Return true if you can reach the last index, or false otherwise.

[leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/jump-game/description/)

### SOLUTION

```java
class Solution {
    
    public boolean canJump(int[] nums) {
        
        int n = nums.length;

        //to track which cells have been visited
        boolean[] visited = new boolean[n];

        //mark first cell as visited
        visited[0] = true;

        //loop through the cells
        for(int i=0; i<n; i++){

            //if the current cell has not been visited, it's impossible to move forward
            if(visited[i] == false) return false;
            
            //get the current max jumps possible
            int x = nums[i];

            //mark the next "x" cells true because it's possible to visit them from the current cell
            for(int j=i+1; j<n && x > 0; j++, x--){
                visited[j] = true;
            }

        }

        //if the last cell was visited, return true
        return visited[n-1] == true;

    }
}
```

### GREEDY SOLUTION

```java
class Solution {

    public boolean canJump(int[] nums) {

        //final destination is index n-1
        int goal = nums.length-1;

        //check from right to left
        //keep checking if the current goal/position is reachable
        //if it's reachabled, update the goal to current index (as it's possible to go from current index to previous goal)
        for(int i=goal-1; i>=0; i--){

            int current = nums[i];

            //if -> current index + max jumps from current index >= current goal
            //we can update the goal to current position
            if(current + i >= goal){
                goal = i;
            }

        }

        //if we have reached 0th index, there was definitely a path from 0th to (n-1)th index
        return goal == 0;

    }
    
}
```
