## PROBLEM DESCRIPTION

You are given an integer array nums. You are initially positioned at the array's first index, and each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position. Return true if you can reach the last index, or false otherwise.

[leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/jump-game/description/)

### SOLUTION

```java
class Solution {
    
    public boolean canJump(int[] nums) {
        
        int n = nums.length;

        //to track which cells have been visited
        boolean[] visited = new boolean[n];

        //mark first cell as visited
        visited[0] = true;

        //loop through the cells
        for(int i=0; i<n; i++){

            //if the current cell has not been visited, it's impossible to move forward
            if(visited[i] == false) return false;
            
            //get the current max jumps possible
            int x = nums[i];

            //mark the next "x" cells true because it's possible to visit them from the current cell
            for(int j=i+1; j<n && x > 0; j++, x--){
                visited[j] = true;
            }

        }

        //if the last cell was visited, return true
        return visited[n-1] == true;

    }
}
```
