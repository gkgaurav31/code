### PROBLEM DESCRIPTION

Given the roots of two binary trees p and q, write a function to check if they are the same or not.
Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical, and the nodes have the same value.

[Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/same-tree/description/)

### SOLUTION

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isSameTree(TreeNode p, TreeNode q) {

        //if p and q both are null, return true
        if(p == null && q == null) return true;

        //if either p or q is null, return false (if both were null, they would have not reached here)
        if(p == null || q == null) return false;
        
        //if the values of p and q are not same, return false
        if(p.val != q.val) return false;

        //at this point, the current nodes are same
        //we need to do the same recursively for LST of p and q & RST of p and q
        return isSameTree(p.left, q.left) && isSameTree(p.right, q.right);

    }
}
```
