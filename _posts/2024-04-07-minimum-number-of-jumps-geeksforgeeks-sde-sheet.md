## PROBLEM DESCRIPTION

Given an array of `N` integers `arr[]` where each element represents the maximum length of the jump that can be made forward from that element. This means if `arr[i] = x`, then we can jump any distance `y` such that `y â‰¤ x`.
Find the minimum number of jumps to reach the end of the array (starting from the first element). If an element is `0`, then you cannot move through that element.

Note: Return `-1`if you can't reach the end of the array.

## SOLUTION

### APPROACH 1 (TLE)

For each position, check all its previous positions and try to figure out the minimum possible steps. If the previous step needed x steps, and it is possible to reach from previous step to current step, then the number of steps will be x+1. Keep doing this for all previous position which can be used to reach the current step and choose the minimum amongst them all.

```java
class Solution{

    static int minJumps(int[] arr){

        int n = arr.length;

        int[] dp = new int[n];

        // init to max value since we need to figure out min later
        Arrays.fill(dp, Integer.MAX_VALUE);

        // 0 steps needed for index 0
        dp[0] = 0;

        for(int i=1; i<n; i++){

            for(int j=0; j<i; j++){

                // it's not possible to reach j, so there's no point in checking if it's possible to reach i from j
                if(dp[j] == Integer.MAX_VALUE)
                    continue;

                // if it's possible reach j from i
                if(arr[j] + j >= i)

                    // choose min between (previous number of steps possible from other options, min steps needed to reach j plus 1)
                    dp[i] = Math.min(dp[i], dp[j] + 1);

            }

        }

        // if it's not possible to reach the end, the value will remain INT_MAX
        return dp[n-1]==Integer.MAX_VALUE?-1:dp[n-1];

    }

}
```
