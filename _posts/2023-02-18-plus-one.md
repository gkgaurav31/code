This question is part of [NeetCode150 series](https://neetcode.io/practice).  

## Problem Description

You are given a large integer represented as an integer array digits, where each digits[i] is the ith digit of the integer. The digits are ordered from most significant to least significant in left-to-right order. The large integer does not contain any leading 0's.

Increment the large integer by one and return the resulting array of digits.

[leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/plus-one/description/)

### Solution

We can start from right to left. Carry will be initialized to 0. The next digit in the answer will be (current digit in N + carry). For right most digit, we will need to add 1 also since the problem is about adding 1 to N. At the end, if any carry is remaining, append that to the answer.

```java
class Solution {

    public int[] plusOne(int[] digits) {

        StringBuffer result = new StringBuffer();

        int carry = 0;

        for(int i=digits.length-1; i>=0; i--){
            
            int s = 0;

            if(i == digits.length-1){
                s = 1 + digits[i] + carry;
            }else{
                s = digits[i] + carry;
            }

            int next = s%10;
            carry = s/10;
            
            result.insert(0, next);

        }

        if(carry > 0) result.insert(0, carry);

        System.out.print(result);

        String[] temp = result.toString().split("");
        int[] ans = new int[temp.length];

        for(int i=0; i<ans.length; i++){
            ans[i] = Integer.parseInt(temp[i]);
        }

        return ans;

    }

}
```
