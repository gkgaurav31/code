## Problem Description

The n-queens puzzle is the problem of placing n queens on an n x n chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.  

Given an integer n, return all distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle. You may return the answer in any order.  

Each solution contains a distinct board configuration of the n-queens' placement, where 'Q' and '.' both indicate a queen and an empty space, respectively.  

### Solution

One important observation is that we cannot place two Queens in the same row (or even the column). The target is to place N Queens. So, we must try to place 1 Queen in each row.  

We solve this by trying every possibility and back tracking when it's not possible to place the Queen in any of the columns for a given row. For every row, we go through all the columns and check if it's possible to place the Queen at that position. If yes, mark that position and go to the next row. After each call is complete, we revert the change made (backtrack).
