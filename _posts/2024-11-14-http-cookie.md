HTTP is stateless, meaning each request is independent, with no memory of previous requests. For example, if you visit a website and add items to a shopping cart, the server doesnâ€™t remember your cart between page loads. HTTP cookies solve this by storing small pieces of data on your browser, allowing the server to "remember" your state.

## CREATE COOKIE

### CLIENT SIDE

Visit any website such as [https://example.com/](https://example.com/)

Open Developer Console (F12) and go to console. We can create a cookie using console via `document.cookie` method.

Example:

```js
document.cookie = "username=gauk;";
```

We can view the cookie from Application tab of the Developer Console.

### SERVER SIDE

We can create a server which will _tell_ the browser to create a cookie.

Here's sample code using ExpressJS:

```js
const express = require("express");
const cookieParser = require("cookie-parser");

const app = express();
app.use(cookieParser());

app.get("/set-cookie", (req, res) => {
  res.cookie("servercookie", "1");
  res.send("Cookie set");
});

app.get("/get-cookie", (req, res) => {
  res.json(req.cookies);
});

app.listen(3000, () => console.log("Server Started. Listening on Port 3000"));
```

The Server's Response will look like this:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/set-cookie -I
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
X-Powered-By: Express
Set-Cookie: servercookie=1; Path=/
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 10
ETag: W/"a-n//AkPpkqXeymDlCsW2AfqfgXjc"
Date: Thu, 14 Nov 2024 17:25:31 GMT
Connection: keep-alive
Keep-Alive: timeout=5
```

In the Server Response, we can see a header called `Set-Cookie` which directs the browser to create the cookie with key `servercookie` and value `1`.

## COOKIE PROPERTIES

### SENT WITH EVERY REQUEST

Cookies are sent automatically with each request to the domain that set them, helping the server recognize the client.

### COOKIE SCOPE

1. Domain: Specifies which domain can access the cookie, e.g., `.example.com` allows all subdomains.

   Example:

   `document.cookie = "username=JohnDoe; domain=.example.com";`

2. Path: Limits the cookie to a specific URL path, such as `/account`.

   Example:

   `document.cookie = "username=JohnDoe; path=/account";`

### EXPIRES AND MAX-AGE

- Expires: Sets a fixed expiration date for the cookie.

  Example:

  `document.cookie = "username=JohnDoe; expires=Thu, 18 Dec 2024 12:00:00 UTC";`

- Max-Age: Specifies how long (in seconds) the cookie lasts from the time it is set.

  Example:

  `document.cookie = "username=JohnDoe; max-age=3600";`

### SAME-SITE
