## PROBLEM DESCRIPTION

You are given the root of a binary tree with unique values, and an integer start. At minute 0, an infection starts from the node with value start.

Each minute, a node becomes infected if:

The node is currently uninfected.
The node is adjacent to an infected node.
Return the number of minutes needed for the entire tree to be infected.

[leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/amount-of-time-for-binary-tree-to-be-infected/description/)

## SOLUTION

### APPROACH 1

If this were an **undirected graph**, we could simply use **BFS** starting from the source node to determine the number of levels. The number of levels would directly correspond to the time required to infect all nodes.

However, in the case of a **binary tree**, we lack direct pointers to parent nodes. To overcome this, we can first create a mapping of each node to its parent without modifying the tree structure. We can achieve this using a **HashMap**, where the `key` is the `node value` and the `value` is a reference to its `parent node`:

`HashMap<Node Value, Parent Node Reference>`

The problem states that all nodes are unique.

#### BFS Traversal

Once we have the parent mapping, we can perform a **BFS traversal** starting from the given `start` node:

1. Add the `start` node to the queue and mark it as visited.
2. For each node, check its **left** and **right** childrenâ€”if they haven't been visited, add them to the queue and mark them as visited.
3. Similarly, retrieve the **parent node** from the HashMap and add it to the queue if it hasn't been visited.

### Edge Case

- The root node has no parent, so its parent reference in the HashMap will be `null`. We need to handle this case separately.

```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode() {}
 *     TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
 *     }
 * }
 */
class Solution {

    // the node which has the value of "start" (all nodes have unique value in this problem)
    TreeNode sourceNode = null;

    public int amountOfTime(TreeNode root, int start) {

        // create a HashMap to determine the parent for any given node
        // Map -> [SourceNode Value, ParentNode]
        Map<Integer, TreeNode> map = createParentMapping(root, start);

        // use BFS to determine the number of level (which will equal to the time needed), from source node
        return burnTimeFromSource(root, map);

    }

    // use BFS from source node
    // binary tree don't have a parent poiner. we will use the map[child, parent] mapping for this
    public int burnTimeFromSource(TreeNode root, Map<Integer, TreeNode> map){

        // to avoid visisted the same node again
        Set<Integer> visited = new HashSet<>();

        // queue for bfs
        Queue<TreeNode> q = new LinkedList<>();

        // add the source node and mark as visited
        q.add(sourceNode);
        visited.add(sourceNode.val);

        // init time:
        // for the first level, the time should be 0
        int time = -1;

        // keep traversing level by level while queue is not empty
        while(!q.isEmpty()){

            // we are at the next level, so increase time by 1
            time++;

            // current number of elements in this level
            int size = q.size();

                // add it to the queue and mark it as visited
                if(current.left != null && !visited.contains(current.left.val)){
                    q.add(current.left);
