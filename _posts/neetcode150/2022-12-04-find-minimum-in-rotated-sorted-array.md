## Problem Description

Suppose an array of length n sorted in ascending order is rotated between 1 and n times. For example, the array nums = [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become:

- [4,5,6,7,0,1,2] if it was rotated 4 times.
- [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] if it was rotated 7 times.

Given the sorted rotated array nums of unique elements, return the minimum element of this array.
You must write an algorithm that runs inÂ O(log n) time.

### Solution

The minimum element will be at the "pivot". So, we just need to find out the pivot index using Binary Search.

```java
class Solution {
    
    public int findMin(int[] nums) {
        
        int l = 0;
        int r = nums.length-1;

        while(l<=r){
            
            int mid = (l+r)/2;

            //If the current number is less than previous one, the current index must be the pivot
            if(mid >= 1 && nums[mid] < nums[mid-1]){
                return nums[mid];
            }

            //If the current number is less than the first number in the array, we need to check on left side of current index
            if(nums[mid] < nums[0]){
                r=mid-1;
            //else check on right side of current index
            }else{
                l=mid+1;
            }

        }

        //If we don't find any pivot, it must be sorted
        return nums[0];

    }
}
```
