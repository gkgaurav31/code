## DESIGN PATTERNS

---

### Creational Design Patterns

:diamond_shape_with_a_dot_inside: [Singleton]({% post_url 2023-07-05-design-pattern-singleton %}): A pattern that ensures a class has only one instance.  

:building_construction: [Builder]({% post_url 2023-07-06-design-pattern-builder %}): A pattern to construct complex objects step by step.  

:clipboard: [Prototype]({% post_url 2023-07-10-design-pattern-prototype %}): A pattern to create new objects by cloning existing ones.  

:factory: [Factory]({% post_url 2023-07-13-design-pattern-factory %}): A pattern to create objects without specifying their concrete classes.  

### Structural Design Patterns

:electric_plug: [Adapter]({% post_url 2023-07-16-design-pattern-adapter %}): A pattern to make incompatible interfaces work together.  

:art: [Decorator]({% post_url 2023-07-16-design-pattern-decorator %}): A pattern to add behavior to an object dynamically.  

:door: [Facade]({% post_url 2023-07-16-design-pattern-facade %}): A pattern to provide a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.  

:balloon: [Flyweight]({% post_url 2023-07-16-design-pattern-flyweight %}): A pattern to minimize memory usage by sharing data among objects.  

### Behavioral Design Patterns

:dart: [Strategy]({% post_url 2023-07-16-design-pattern-strategy %}): A pattern to encapsulate interchangeable algorithms.  

:eyes: [Observer]({% post_url 2023-07-17-design-pattern-observer %}): A pattern to define a one-to-many dependency between objects.
