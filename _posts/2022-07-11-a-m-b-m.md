## Problem Description

Given two integers A and B, find the greatest possible positive integer M, such that A % M = B % M.

### Solution

This problem needs some derivation:

> A%M = B%M  
> => A%M - B%M = 0  
> => A%M - B%M + M = M //add M on both sides  
> => (A%M - B%M + M)%M = M%M //take mod on both sides  
> => (A-B)%M = 0 //Since (A%M - B%M + M)%M equals (A-B)%M [Modular Arithematic](https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/math/number-theory/basic-number-theory-1/tutorial/)  

So, we can say that if A%M=B%M, then A-B must be divisible by M. In other words, M is a multiple of A-B. Obviously, the largest number which can divide A-B will be the absolute of (A-B).

```java
public class Solution {
    public int solve(int A, int B) {
        return Math.abs(A-B);
    }
}
```
