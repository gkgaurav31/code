### PROBLEM DESCRIPTION

An n-bit gray code sequence is a sequence of 2n integers where:

- Every integer is in the inclusive range [0, 2n - 1],
- The first integer is 0,
- An integer appears no more than once in the sequence,
- The binary representation of every pair of adjacent integers differs by exactly one bit, and
- The binary representation of the first and last integers differs by exactly one bit.

Given an integer n, return any valid n-bit gray code sequence.

### SOLUTION

![snapshot]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/gray_code.png)

```java
class Solution {

    public List<Integer> grayCode(int n) {

        //base condition: for n=0, the result is only 0
        if(n == 0){
            List<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>();
            list.add(0);
            return list;
        }

        //get the answer for n-1
        List<Integer> list = grayCode(n-1);

        //answer list
        List<Integer> ans = new ArrayList<>();

        //the first half will be same as for n-1
        for(int i=0; i<list.size(); i++){
            ans.add(list.get(i));
        }

        //the second half will be sum of previous + 2^n-1, as we are include a set bit at the MSB position n-1
        //we need to do this in reverse so that the difference between the bits is not more than 1, to follow the gray code
        for(int i=list.size()-1; i>=0; i--){
            ans.add(list.get(i) + (1<<n-1));
        }

        return ans;

    }

}
```
