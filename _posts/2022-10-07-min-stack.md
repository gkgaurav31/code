### PROBLEM DESCRIPTION

Design a stack that supports push, pop, top, and retrieving the minimum element in constant time.

Implement the MinStack class:

    MinStack() initializes the stack object.
    void push(int val) pushes the element val onto the stack.
    void pop() removes the element on the top of the stack.
    int top() gets the top element of the stack.
    int getMin() retrieves the minimum element in the stack.

You must implement a solution with O(1) time complexity for each function.

### SOLUTION

Instead of pushing just the values, we will keep a track of the currentMin and push it along with the value to be added to the stack!

```java
class MinStack {

private Stack<int[]> stack = new Stack<>();

public MinStack() {
    
}

public void push(int val) {
    
    if(stack.isEmpty()){
        stack.push(new int[]{val, val});
        return;
    }
    
    int currentMin = Math.min(val, stack.peek()[1]);
    stack.push(new int[]{val, currentMin});
}

public void pop() {
    stack.pop();
}

public int top() {
    return stack.peek()[0];
}

public int getMin() {
    return stack.peek()[1];
}
}
```
