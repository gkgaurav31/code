## PROBLEM DESCRIPTION

Given an array of integers citations where citations[i] is the number of citations a researcher received for their ith paper, return the researcher's h-index.

According to the definition of [h-index on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-index): The h-index is defined as the maximum value of h such that the given researcher has published at least h papers that have each been cited at least h times.

[leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/h-index/)

## SOLUTION

Since we are looking for the maximum citation, it would make sense to first sort the list. Also, the h-index should be equal to the number of papers which has been cited, so we would keep to keep a count of how many papers we have checked. Even if the number of citations for current paper is more that it, it does not make a difference because it should match with the number of papers that has been cited.

```java
class Solution {

    public int hIndex(int[] citations) {
        
        int n = citations.length;

        int maxH = 0;

        //number of papers
        int currentH = 0;

        Arrays.sort(citations); 

        //loop from right so that we start from the largest number        
        for(int i=n-1; i>=0; i--){
            
            //increase the number of papers
            currentH++;

            //if the current number of citations is more, we can be sure that anything ahead of it was also more and this can be the largest value
            if(citations[i] >= currentH){
                maxH = currentH;
            }

        }

        return maxH;

    }

}
```
